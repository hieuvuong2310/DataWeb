# DataWeb
Prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/xeShEAaSPDt4Ffl2C5gjwi/DataWeb?node-id=0%3A1&t=BEidx2EiapDUsMgH-1

This web is served for performing data physicalization
This is used to collect the information to apply for research topic, which is how physical data visualization affects teamwork's productivity at VIXI Lab at University of Victoria.
The participants in this research will be using this web as a tool for them to control physical data visualization, which is the physical Arduino attached to 3D printed model. When everything is set up on the website, they can have the permission to control their physical objects via IP address. 

Another part of this project involves using Arduino attached to physical objects to perform visualization. In more detail, the physical objects are gumball machines, balls, and containers. Users will visualize their data by dropping their balls into the correct container representing for their assigned activity. 

Guide to get started with the web:
1. You need to register for the account, or log in to your exisiting account. 
You have to option to register as a leader or a member of the team

2. If this is your first time registering, you need to give information about your project and your team
AS A LEADER: you need to give some information about your project, your number of members, number of activities that your team want to visualize to keep track of the progress

AS A MEMBER: you need to input the invitation code from your leader to access your project team

3. You will be in the dashboard of your role
LEADER: you can assign the team member their tasks and the required time. In the 1st table you can keep track of their progress whether they have finished it or not. In the 2nd table, you can keep track of the work they have finished

MEMBER: you can see your assigned tasks, and then you have the option to visualize it (drop a ball in the physical objects into their correct activities to indicate that you have finished that activities and the amount of time it takes you to finish it), indicating that you have finished the assigned task.

4. AS A LEADER: you need to map the physical object to the online value so that when performing visualization, it will send the correct request to the exact objects to ensure the accuracy of the product

5. AS A MEMBER: you can set up auto-dropping the balls representing for the amount of time you spend on working some specific activity.

6. Profile page:
AS A LEADER: you can get the invitation code here and share it to other team members so that they can have access to the project
BOTH ROLE: They can log out their account in this page
